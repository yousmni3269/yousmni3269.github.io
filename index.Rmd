# About Me

I am currently a first year student studying MS [Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics) at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 


I received a BS in Chemical Engineering from [Cornell University](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu) in 2017. After graduating, I started my career at [Samsung Biologics](https://samsungbiologics.com), a Biopharmaceutical Company in South Korea and worked for about 6.5 years. 

#  More About Me

I love spicy food and wine. 

I enjoy hiking, trekking and running as well. I finished my first Camino de Santiago this summer! This is a picture of a cow that I met during the walk.
